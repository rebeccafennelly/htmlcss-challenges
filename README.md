## Getting started

### Create a Fork

Students should complete the challenges in their own forked version of the challenges repository.

1. To fork this repository click the fork button in the top right of the repository page on github.

2. If asked, select your own github account as the place to host the forked version.

### Completing a challenge

We follow github flow for each challenge. This means creating a new branch, completing the challenge and submitting a pull request.

1. Create a branch from master. The branch name should be that of the challenge being done, e.g. text-grouping
```
git checkout -b <challenge-name>
```
2. Complete the challenge by writing your code in the challenge.html and challenge.css files (there are template challenge files included for you to use).
3. Commit your work as you complete the challenge and push up the branch to github.
4. When ready, create a pull request and assign a trainer as a reviwer.
5. If approved you can close the pull request and merge the code. If there are comments then continue commiting your work on the existing branch and push to github, this will appear in the pull request.
