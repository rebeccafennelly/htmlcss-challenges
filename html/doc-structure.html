            <h1>Structure and Functions of Microtubules</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Microtubules form as a highly organised network of polarised
                    tube filaments from a protein called tubulin (John & Dave, 2016).
                    Its regulation is needed for processes such as mitosis, cell
                    migration, cell signalling and cell trafficking. The microtubules
                    themselves are regulated by several kinases and phosphatases via
                    signalling cascades, and concomitantly by interactions with actin
                    cytoskeleton and adhesion sites.

                <h2>Cell Morphology and Function</h2>
                <p>
                    As the name implies, microtubules are hollow tubes having an
                    external diameter of roughly 25nm and a cell wall thickness of
                    5-7nm. One of their functions is to transport organelles (e.g.
                    secretetory vesicles) through the cytoplasm, a particularly important
                    role in nerve cells where axoplasmic flow is required. They also have a
                    critical role in cilia and flagella movement. Microtubules originate
                    from a complex structure known as centrosome.

                    Between cell divisions, the centrosome is located at the centre of a
                    cell near the nucleus. Embedded in the centrosome are two cylindrical
                    centrioles, arranged at right angles to each other (Murphy & Farrell, 2012).
                    At the onset of cell division, a centrosome divides and the two daughter
                    centrosomes move to opposite poles of the nucleus to form a mitotic spindle
